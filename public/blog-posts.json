Expect massive crowds and gridlock on major routes.\n\n## If You're Going to the Game\n\n### To the Stadium\n\nStart your trip 3-4 hours before kickoff to arrive by 5 PM. Gates open at 6:20 PM; parking lots at 4:20 PM.\n\n- From NYC: Depart by 3:30 PM via Lincoln Tunnel or GWB.\n- From NJ: Leave by 4 PM on NJ Turnpike or I-95.\n- Expected inbound delays: 30-60 min on I-95 N and Route 3 E starting 5 PM.\n\n### From the Stadium\n\nGame ends around 11:30 PM; plan exit by midnight to avoid peak exodus (11:30 PM-2 AM).\n\n- To NYC: Head out by 12:30 AM; use Route 3 W to I-95 S.\n- To NJ: Depart immediately post-game via NJ Turnpike S.\n- Outbound delays: 45-90 min on local roads and bridges until 2 AM.\n\n### Route Planning\n\nPrimary routes include I-95 and the NJ Turnpike. Congestion starts 3 hours before kickoff.\n\n| Route | Expected Delay | Alternative |\n|-------|----------------|-------------|\n| I-95 N | 45-60 min | Route 17 N |\n| NJ Turnpike | 30-45 min | Garden State Parkway |\n| Route 3 E | 20-30 min | Local roads via Lyndhurst |\n\n### Parking Strategies\n\nMetLife offers 20,000+ spots, but they fill fast.\n\n- Pre-book: Reserve via the stadium app.\n- Preferred lots: Tailgate-friendly areas near Gate 7 (Lot G).\n- Cost: $40-60; arrive early for better spots.\n- Alternatives: Park-and-ride from Secaucus Junction.\n\n### Public Transit Options\n\n- NJ Transit Rail: From NY Penn Station to Meadowlands Rail Line (20 min ride).\n- Buses: NJ Transit #126 from Port Authority.\n- Schedules: Trains every 15 min pre-game; delays post-game.\n\n## If You Want to Avoid Game Traffic\n\n### Directions to Avoid\n\nFrom 3-11 PM, dodge these inbound directions:\n\n- Northbound I-95 from Newark to Fort Lee\n- Westbound NJ Turnpike Exits 16W-18\n- Eastbound Route 3 and Paterson Plank Road\n\nPost-game (11 PM-2 AM): Avoid southbound I-95, eastbound Route 3, and GWB/Lincoln Tunnel approaches.\n\nImpact: Up to 2-hour delays.\n\n### Alternate Routes\n\n- From NYC: Holland Tunnel to Route 1&9, then Route 7.\n- From NJ: Garden State Parkway to Route 440, avoiding Turnpike.\n- From West: Route 80 to Route 46, then local to I-287.\n\n| Origin | Alternate Route | Time Savings |\n|--------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Manhattan | Route 1&9 Tpk | 30-45 min |\n| Newark | Route 21 N | 20-30 min |\n| Paramus | Route 4 E to 17 S | 15-25 min |\n\n### Optimal Travel Times\n\n- Inbound avoidance: Before 2 PM or after 11 PM.\n- Outbound: Travel before 3 PM or after 2 AM.\n- Midday: 10 AM-2 PM safest.\n\n### Local Impact Areas\n\n- East Rutherford: Surface streets jammed.\n- Secaucus/Weehawken: Bridge/tunnel backups.\n- Fort Lee: GWB approach clogged.\n\n\n\n> Key Takeaway: Game traffic can add 1-2 hours; plan departures to cut delays by 50%."
