# Google Maps API Optimization Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the optimizations implemented to minimize Google Maps API requests and prevent duplicate calls.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. **Route Caching** ✅
- **What**: Implemented a cache to store direction results for previously calculated routes
- **How**: Routes are cached with a unique key based on start and end locations (case-insensitive)
- **Duration**: Cache entries are valid for 1 hour
- **Size Limit**: Maximum 50 cached routes to prevent excessive memory usage
- **Impact**: Eliminates duplicate API calls for the same route within the cache validity period

### 2. **Request Deduplication** ✅
- **What**: Prevents multiple simultaneous route calculations for the same route
- **How**: Uses `currentCalculationKey` to track in-flight requests
- **Impact**: Prevents race conditions when multiple triggers occur in quick succession

### 3. **Shared Service Instances** ✅
- **What**: Reuses `AutocompleteService` and `PlacesService` instances instead of creating new ones
- **Before**: New instances created on every Enter key press (lines 802, 830)
- **After**: Single instances created once during map initialization and reused
- **Impact**: Reduces object creation overhead and potential memory leaks

### 4. **Debounced Route Calculation** ✅
- **What**: Added `calculateRouteDebounced()` function with 300ms delay
- **Usage**: Can be used for scenarios where rapid successive calls might occur
- **Impact**: Prevents excessive API calls during rapid user interactions

### 5. **Proper Cleanup** ✅
- **What**: Added cleanup in `onBeforeUnmount()` lifecycle hook
- **Cleanup includes**:
  - Clear pending route calculation timeouts
  - Clear route cache to free memory
  - Remove event listeners from autocomplete and directions renderer
- **Impact**: Prevents memory leaks and ensures clean component destruction

## Code Changes Summary

### New State Variables
```javascript
const routeCache = ref(new Map())
const autocompleteService = ref(null)
const placesService = ref(null)
let calculateRouteTimeout = null
let currentCalculationKey = null
```

### New Helper Functions
- `getCacheKey(start, end)` - Creates unique cache keys
- `getCachedRoute(start, end)` - Retrieves cached route data
- `setCachedRoute(start, end, data)` - Stores route data in cache
- `isCacheValid(cacheEntry)` - Validates cache freshness
- `calculateRouteDebounced()` - Debounced version of route calculation

### Modified Functions
- `calculateRoute()` - Now checks cache first and prevents duplicate in-flight requests
- `setupMap()` - Initializes shared service instances
- `handleEnterKey()` - Uses shared service instances instead of creating new ones
- `onBeforeUnmount()` - Added comprehensive cleanup

## API Call Flow (After Optimization)

1. **User triggers route calculation**
2. **Check if already calculating** - Exit if same route is in progress
3. **Check cache** - Return cached result if valid
4. **Mark as in-progress** - Set `currentCalculationKey`
5. **Check rate limit** - Exit if limit exceeded
6. **Make API call** - Only if all checks pass
7. **Cache result** - Store for future use
8. **Clear in-progress flag** - Allow future calculations

## Expected Impact

### API Request Reduction
- **Route recalculations**: ~80-90% reduction for repeated routes
- **Service instantiation**: ~100% reduction (reusing instances)
- **Race condition calls**: ~100% elimination

### Performance Improvements
- Faster response for cached routes (instant vs 200-500ms API call)
- Reduced memory usage from fewer service instances
- Better user experience with immediate cached results

## Monitoring & Logging

The following console logs are included for debugging:
- `"Using cached route"` - When serving from cache
- `"Route calculation already in progress"` - When preventing duplicates

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Persistent Cache**: Consider using localStorage to persist cache across sessions
2. **Cache Invalidation**: Add smarter cache invalidation based on time of day (for traffic-dependent routes)
3. **Prefetching**: Preload popular routes during idle time
4. **Batch Requests**: If multiple routes needed, consider batching API calls
5. **Service Worker**: Cache static map tiles and assets

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with repeated route selections (should use cache)
2. Test rapid route changes (should prevent duplicates)
3. Test after 1 hour (cache should invalidate)
4. Test component unmounting (no memory leaks)
5. Monitor browser Network tab to verify reduced API calls

## Notes

- Rate limiting (20 routes/day) is still in place and checked before API calls
- Cache is cleared on component unmount to prevent stale data
- All optimizations are transparent to the user experience
